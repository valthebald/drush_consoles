                This talk is largely based on my Drupal Europe presentation
                Main feedback that I got is that the session contained too much of math.
                I cannot completely avoid mathematics when talking about machine learning,
                but tried to reduce its usage to reasonable minimum. Hold tight!

Since machine learning is a very wide topic, we will be able to discuss only small part of it.
Luckily, there are many resources, including Drupal-specific, that can help you in using ML in your everyday activity
So first, we will skip ready, commercial APIs from companies like Google (Cloud API), or MicroSoft (Azure Cognitive Services).
Both have Drupal modules and work with either pretrained or DIY data sets, for the real life examples of integrating Google SDKs with local
news service Patch.com you can watch Pantheon's webinar (link in the end).

We also will not talk about tasks that have known solutions, and even Drupal modules - for the list of those I recommend reading OpenSense post
on top Drupal modules that use AI.

In other words, let's jump to the land of unknown, and start from the basics - what is machine learning

						Let's imagine you build a site with multiple pages. You can have different monetizing models: you can sell items,
						profit from advertiser, or get financed by some government organisation based on your traffic numbers.
						You have a lot of items to "sell" to the customer (in quotes because money is not always involved in the process),
						and you constantly adding new items.

						You have few areas where you list important (from your PoV) items: top menu, featured block etc.
						You can even measure performance of those items using A/B testing tools.

						But if you a new item with no known performance, how do you decide whether to replace existing featured items? Let's try
						to formulate the question in the terms of the previous slide.

						T - predicting CTR, average purchase, time on page etc.
						E - data collected from analytics data or/and webserver log analysis

			Before digging into Umami dilemma, let's first talk about machine learning tasks types - i.e. T in the definition of machine learning
			One group of task classes is supervised learning. It's when our experimental data E is "labelled",
			i.e. for every item in E we know "correct" value - i.e. what is CTR.
            Regression - predicted values are within continious range, i.e.
            Given a picture of Male/Female, We have to predict his/her age on the basis of given picture.
            Classification - predicted value is boolean, i.e. given a picture of Male/Female, We have to predict Whether He/She is of High school, College, Graduate age. Another Example for Classification - Banks have to decide whether or not to give a loan to someone on the basis of his credit history.

                The simplest and by far the most popular method for approximating experimental data is linear regression,
                i.e. hypothesis function - our prediction function - is the linear function
                Mathematicians use these fancy variable names theta to confuse everyone, but essentially function on the slide describes
                a line. Line has 2 parameters: offset from 0 (theta_0) and slope (theta_1)

                Our task is to find such values of theta that "fit better" experimental data.

                Intuitively it's clear that dark blue line more accurately describes the experimental data
                (thus can predict CTR for the new products).

                More accurate means smaller difference between predicted and experimental data.

                What we need to do is go over all experimental data, and sum the distance from predicted and actial values

            <aside class="notes">
                To find the best values of theta, we start from random values (typically from zeros, but can be any starting point),
                perform small change of theta, and then change them towards  the direction of smaller error values

                In general case, final result of gradient descent is not necessarily the best one - pitfall of local minimums.
                Luckily, for linear regression cost function is always convex, so we end up at the global minimum.

                Adding new features is also a way to have non-linear derivatives of original features, but still use linear regression.
                In our example my guess would be that logarithm function is better approximation than line.
                But we still can use linear regression, if we add a new feature theta_2, that will be equal to logarithm of theta_1

                There are also naturally other features, like price, country, brand, date of release (freshness) etc.
                Country and brand are themselves not single, but multiple features:
                If you're not Donald Trump, you're probably won't tell that US is no.1, UK is no.2 etc. - but even then, how can you assign values
                to other countries? Correct way is to have multiple features, each one having value 0 or 1 - so if we sell to 50 countries,
                we should define 50 binary features.

                Let's address the first challenge when working with website visitors data - it is huge.
                We calculate the cost function by going over ALL data items, and compare predicted and actual label values.

                We do that for every step of changing parameters. This method is reliable, but slow

            <h3>Stochastic gradient descent</h3>

            <img src="media/ctr-position.png" alt="Experiment" />

            <ul>
                <li>Shuffle training set</li>
                <li>Perform gradient descent for single example</li>
                <li>Choose low &alpha;!</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes"><pre>
                What if we take even smaller steps, but get some benefit from going over not the full set of experimental data,
                but only one?

                This method called stochastic gradient descent. Due to its nature, it's not guaranteed that you only go down finding the global minimum of cost function,
                but if you have large, randomly distributed set, you'll get to the point - and much quicker than in case of "regular" gradient descent
                (which is also called batch gradient descent)

            <h2>Online learning</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Process training examples as they go</li>
                <li>Adjust parameters &theta; after every example</li>
                <li>Throw examples immediately</li>
                <li class="fragment">Bonus: adjust to changing users preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes"><pre>
                Online learning is the process when you don't have static experimental data,
                but instead you constantly get a stream of new items.
                This is very similar to stochastic gradient descent process that we have seen on the previous slide.
                We get data items one by one, adjust theta values by small portion, and immediately throw away incoming data.
                Bonus - we adjust to changing user preferences!
